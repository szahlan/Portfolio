  <h2>A little bit about myself...</h2>
  <p>My name is Sana. I'm a graduate from the <em> University of Washington</em> with a chemistry degree. I worked in retail while attending school then moved to the medical field. I currently work as a Treament Coordinator at Gentle Dental. I am fluent in <strong>English</strong> and <strong>Arabic</strong>, and took 7 years of <strong>French.</strong> As an undergraduate, I took a Computer Science course that I really enjoyed. My time in that class inspired me to enroll at Epicodus, and I can't wait to see where this journey takes me!</p>
