  <h2>A little bit about myself...</h2>
  <p>My name is Sana. I'm a graduate from the <em> University of Washington</em> with a chemistry degree. I worked in retail while attending school then moved to the medical field. I currently work as a Treament Coordinator at Gentle Dental. I am fluent in <strong>English</strong> and <strong>Arabic</strong>, and took 7 years of <strong>French.</strong> As an undergraduate, I took a Computer Science course that I really enjoyed. My time in that class inspired me to enroll at Epicodus, and I can't wait to see where this journey takes me!</p>

  <h2>My projects</h2>
  <ul class="list">
    <li><a href="https://github.com/szahlan/band-webpage">Band Webpage</a></li>
    <p>I created this page using HTML & CSS to practice <span class="important">The Box Model.</span> I also incorporated <span class="important">Floats</span> to create a sidebar.</p>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/szahlan/Animal-Shelter">Animal Shelter</a></li>
    <p>This project also uses HTML & CSS. I created it to practice <span class="important">Cascading.</span> It also uses <span class="important">Floats</span> to create separate columns for each of the animals.</p>
